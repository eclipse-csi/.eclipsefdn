description: |-
  This blueprint will create a PR that will add a default CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file to the `.github` repo of your GitHub organization if it does not yet exist.
  You can adjust the PR as needed to fit it to your needs. If a repo defines a more specific CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file it will take precedence of the one present in the `.github` repo.
