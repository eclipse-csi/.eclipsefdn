name: Adds a default SECURITY.md file
description: |-
  This blueprint will create a PR that will add a default SECURITY.md file to the `.github` repo of your GitHub organization if it does not yet exist.
  You can adjust the PR as needed to fit it to your needs. If a repo defines a more specific SECURITY.md file it will take precedence of the one present in the `.github` repo.

        This Eclipse Foundation Project adheres to the [Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy/).
        
        ## How To Report a Vulnerability
        
        If you think you have found a vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.
        
        **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests.**
        
        Instead, report it using one of the following ways:

        * Contact the [Eclipse Foundation Security Team](mailto:security@eclipse-foundation.org) via email
        * Create a [confidential issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/new?issuable_template=new_vulnerability) in the Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Tracker
        
        You can find more information about reporting and disclosure at the [Eclipse Foundation Security page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/).

        Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:
       
        * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
        * Affected version(s)
        * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
        * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
        * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
        * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
        * Configuration required to reproduce the issue
        * Log files that are related to this issue (if possible)
        * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
        
        This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
